# **Magic-Gamma-Telescope**
Magic Gamma Telescope is a classification project to classify two types of gamma rays in the air or environment. These are g &amp; h. Here are codes and apps to check.

### **Situation**

Needed to accurately classify gamma rays using data from the Magic Gamma Telescope; existing methods were inefficient.

### **Task**

- Analyze and preprocess data. 
- Develop a machine learning classification model. 
- Create an interactive visualization tool.

### **Action**

- Cleaned data, removed outliers, and encoded variables. 
- Use different Machine Learning Models to select the best one
- Built a Streamlit app for real-time user interaction.

### **Result**

- Achieved 87% accuracy in classifying gamma rays.
- Provided clear data insights with visualizations.
- Developed an app for better data-driven decisions and telescope performance.
